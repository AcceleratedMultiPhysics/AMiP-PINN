PINN codes from the [Accelerated Multiphysics Research Group](https://blog.metu.edu.tr/akarakus). The codes are implementations of training algorithms of the following papers

- [Physics-informed neural networks for weakly compressible flows using Galerkin–Boltzmann formulation](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article-abstract/36/11/117125/3319182/Physics-informed-neural-networks-for-weakly)
- [Physics-informed neural networks for mesh deformation with exact boundary enforcement](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952197623008448)
- [Physics informed neural networks for two dimensional incompressible thermal convection problems](https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/isibted/article/1194992)
